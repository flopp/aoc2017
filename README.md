# flopp/aoc2017

My solutions for the awesome [Advent Of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) - an advent calendar for programmers.

Running individual days:

```
# enter the desired directory (day/language):
cd 01/c++

# run part1 tests
make test1

# run part1 puzzle
make puzzle1

# run part2 tests
make test2

# run part2 puzzle
make puzzle2
```
